# textAnimationScroll

This is Project is a test for my Portfolio animation hero section
  -Here I am trying to figure out a way to get a cool but simple animation usign Gsap
  -The focus here is more on the CSS than anything else although the animation is done with a JavaScript animation library
  
  # How to Navigate
  The navigation is pretty simple:
    -You'll find the dependencies in the Package.json
    -In the Assets folder is the images and the font I used
    -In styles is the css, the base file is importing styles.css
    
    # Thank You !
